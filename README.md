# Querying-The-Movie-Database
As part of the ALX students challenge, I undertook an exploration of a movie database to answer some interesting questions about films and their attributes. By leveraging SQL, I was able to uncover the following insights:

1. Oscar Winner for “Actor in a Leading Role” in 2015: I discovered that Leonardo DiCaprio won this award.

2. Ten Oldest Movies in the Database: The ten oldest movies include Intolerance, The Big Parade, Metropolis, Pandora's Box, The Broadway Melody, Hell's Angels, A Farewell to Arms, 42nd Street, She Done Him Wrong, and It Happened One Night.

3. Unique Awards in the Oscars Table: There are 114 unique awards listed in the Oscars table.

4. Movies Containing the Word “Spider” in Their Title: The database contains 9 movies with “Spider” in their titles.

5. Movies in the “Thriller” Genre Containing the Word “Love” in Keywords: I found 48 movies that belong to the Thriller genre and also contain the word “love” within their keywords.
